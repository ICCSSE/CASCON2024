<h2>Bob Blainey, RBC Fellow</h2>

<h1>Software Delivery Excellence at the Royal Bank of Canada (RBC) – Moving Fast and Not Breaking Things</h1>

<p>RBC is Canada’s biggest bank and one of the largest in the world based on market capitalization with over 100,000 employees serving more than 18 million clients in Canada, the United States and 27 other countries. Any organization of this complexity invests deeply in software to automate operations, support staff, and engage their clients.  This is no different at RBC, but we also have a special responsibility to win and retain the trust of our clients as we operate across multiple lines of business in many jurisdictions globally which must comply with numerous regulations. This talk will discuss how RBC’s software delivery process has evolved to ensure new products and innovations are delivered quickly to clients while maintaining the highest standard of safety and security. Featured discussions will include how to resolve the tension between control and innovation, the imperative to build secure systems, and the impact we’re seeing of AI on our architecture and software delivery process.</p>
