CASCON is a premier academic and industrial conference for advanced studies in computer science and software engineering. Since 1991, CASCON has attracted software developers, researchers, innovators, technologists and decision-makers from academia, industry, and government, who come together to learn about technology trends, present papers, participate in workshops, and exhibit prototypes and solutions.
The conference program features thought-provoking keynotes, original research papers, stimulating workshops, and an engaging technology expo. Conference proceedings are published in the ACM Digital Library (<a href=https://dl.acm.org/conference/cascon>https://dl.acm.org/conference/cascon</a>).
We are happy to announce that this year CASCON will be co-located with CSCAN-INFOCAN, aiming to promote knowledge sharing, networking, and innovation in Canadian computer science and related fields.
